# Toddler Typer

A simple application for Microsoft Windows that will allow your toddler to play at pressing buttons on the keyboard in a cut-down word processor environment, without the risk of them messing up the rest of your computer.

Toddler Typer protects your computer in the following ways:
* Runs full-screen, so your toddler can't interact with your desktop or with other applications.
* Runs as a "top-most window", so even if your toddler manages to launch a different application, Toddler Typer will still stay on top.
* Doesn't have an "exit" button, so your toddler can't accidentally close the application. If you want to close it, just use the standard `ALT+F4` hotkey.
* If you have a multi-monitor system, Toddler Typer will launch simultaneously on every screen.

## Hotkeys

Toddler Typer doesn't have any buttons, to keep everything toddler-safe.

If you want to control Toddler Typer, the following hotkeys are available:

* `ALT + F4` to exit Toddler Typer.
* `CTRL + UP ARROW` to increase the font size.
* `CTRL + DOWN ARROW` to decrease the font size.

## Download

You can get the official release of [Toddler Typer on the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/toddler-typer/9pb5j8zb1fdh).

Alternatively, you can download the raw executable from [here](https://downloads.mking.net/ToddlerTyper.exe). This version is not signed with an [Authenticode certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode) (because I don't have hundreds of dollars spare to spend on a certificate for Toddler Typer), so you may see a pop-up from [Microsoft SmartScreen Filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/what-is-smartscreen-and-how-can-it-help-protect-me-1c9a874a-6826-be5e-45b1-67fa445a74c8) when you download it. If you're a tech pro you'll know what to do - but if not, I recommend just grabbing it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/toddler-typer/9pb5j8zb1fdh) instead.
