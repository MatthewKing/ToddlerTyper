# Toddler Typer

A simple application for Microsoft Windows that will allow your toddler to play at pressing buttons on the keyboard in a cut-down word processor environment, without the risk of them messing up the rest of your computer.

Toddler Typer protects your computer in the following ways:
* Runs full-screen, so your toddler can't interact with your desktop or with other applications.
* Runs as a "top-most window", so even if your toddler manages to launch a different application, Toddler Typer will still stay on top.
* Doesn't have an "exit" button, so your toddler can't accidentally close the application. If you want to close it, just use the standard `ALT+F4` hotkey.
* If you have a multi-monitor system, Toddler Typer will launch simultaneously on every screen.
